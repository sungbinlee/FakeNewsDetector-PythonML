# FakeNewsDetector-PythonML
A Study on Fake News Detection Model and Implementation with Python and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project conducted a research on implementing a machine learning model for detecting fake news. With the recent surge of misinformation, particularly related to COVID-19, tackling fake news has become a significant issue. As a solution, the study proposes utilizing machine learning models to address this problem.

To accomplish this, the project provides conceptual explanations of various concepts such as natural language processing (NLP), classification, fake news detection, topic modeling, and word embeddings. The implementation involves using Python, NLP, and machine learning algorithms, specifically the Passive-Aggressive algorithm. Additionally, the project covers the usage of TF-IDF and word embeddings for fake news detection.

The project includes the construction of an actual model. The specific process involves utilizing the Kaggle dataset for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Ultimately, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning to detect fake news, providing benefits to both the media industry and consumers. However, it highlights the need for more data and more accurate modeling techniques to achieve better performance.
